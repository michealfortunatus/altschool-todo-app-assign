# altschool-todo-app-assign

## Context/Requirements:
As a professional, we are engaged in a lot of tasks day in and day out and we need to organize our tasks effectively . One way that comes to mind is to use a simple todo application and we can build it using Nodejs. Tasks can be in three states; pending, completed, deleted. We should have a UI interface to see the list of tasks, create tasks and also change the task to completed or deleted. We also want our friends and their friends to be able to use this app, so we need to add authentication for users to sign up and login. Users should be able to sort between pending and completed tasks.


## Your Task:
1. Create UI interface for the todo app using EJS(or any template view that works for you)
2 .Have authentication and authentication setup so users can only see their task, just  username and password
3 .Create an ER diagram to show relationships between users and tasks
4.Write tests where possible
5.Handle errors globally and locally
6.Use logs and try to maintain a format
7.For the design of the UI, keep it simple
8.Host your application on any hosting platform
9.Use MongoDB as your database
